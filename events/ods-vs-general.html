            One of the most powerful live broadcasts ever! With all the available audio and video equipment, getting from one end of Latvia to almost the other end of Latvia (Livani) by public transport was a challenge, but it all worked out. The charity game was broadcast with 4 cameras - 3x Canon Camcorder, which were connected straight to the Decklink, and 1 Panasonic GH5 (my camera, which I also filmed with), which was mounted on a Zhiyun Crane 2 stabiliser, with a Blackmagic HDMI to SDI converter attached to allow the camera to be connected to a Teradek Bolt 600 wireless transmitter.
