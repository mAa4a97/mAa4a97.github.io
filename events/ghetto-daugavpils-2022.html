        <p>
            I do remember, I think day or two before this event I got asked, do I want to go to Daugavpils... without hesitation I said yes!<br>
            That was the first ever time when I had the opportunity to use professional camera gear. I had struggles at first, because I had to learn how to use it in narrow time period, which wasn't enough and also the camera, which was Sony PXW-X70, had turned on auto-focus and allways, it went out of focus, so I had to fight it. At noon, because it was darker, I didn't had any issues.<br>
            But... that might have been the turning point in my career to start working in livestream industry.
