        <p>
            This was also one of the strangest events I had.<br>
            Right before the finals, I got approached by GARĀŽA CEO mitins, can I help out with finals of kleverr tournament which was happening. Of course, I agreed and the event actually was pretty good. With 0 budget (except prize pool), we made great livestream, but less did I know... it was just a beggining of something much bigger.
