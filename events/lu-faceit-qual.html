            This was the most unexpected event I have ever done... Pretty shure, the day before the event, I got message from GARĀŽA to help out with observing Latvian University hosted FaceIt Collegiate Latvian Qualifiers. Also, with that tournament, I had my first experience with remote broadcasting, by providing so called clean feed.
