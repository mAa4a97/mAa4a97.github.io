            This might have been the first ever event, where I had huge responsibilitty - live graphics operator.<br>
            But I hear the question - "what is that? What does this person do?" - it means that this person has to toggle live graphics (scoreboard), set, beggin and pause the clock and also set the score for the teams. For that exact event there was small problem... Usually, if graphics operator misses the goal or something, he can just look up from the referees or jumbotron (for example, usually in huge arenas so called central cube or something else), but for this event graphics operator was responsible also for the screen outside production zone.<br>
            It was challenging... but did I managed it? I think... yes!
