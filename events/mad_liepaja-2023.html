            This was happening still in time, while I was working in You+.<br>
            In short this is  the largest open-type Action sports festival in Latvia and not just that... it also includes youth festival with various activities and organizations.<br>
            That year I was responsible not just for photos, but for Youth festivals podcast recordings and also, the livestream of Mad LiepƒÅja Pro finals.<br>
            Did it went great? Honestly, not really, hower it gave me ideas on how to improve it for upcoming years.
