            First experience in the larger field of live broadcasting. Playing video games, I got to know some nice players - lmn8 and Mjeeeks. In a funny way, lmn8 asked me if I wanted to be an observer for a "small" Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS) tournament. I had experience in CS, both playing and making live graphics, but being an observer(?) - not really. But okay, I agreed. It turned out that this was not a small tournament, but a Baltic-wide tournament organized by Ghetto Games
