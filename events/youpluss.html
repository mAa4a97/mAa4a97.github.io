        <p>
            At spring of 2023 I noticed that You+ was looking for new members trough national employment agancies program.
            I applied and I got in.<br>
            In short, my responsibilities were helping with PR, by making photos of different events, creating some designs not just for publications, but also for merch, and help with their website.
