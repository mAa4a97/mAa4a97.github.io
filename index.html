            <h1>Ghetto eGames Baltics Open 2022</h1>
            <h2>Biggest turning point into semi-proffesional</h2>
            <p>While I was playing CS:GO, I was very interested into e-sports event broadcasts of that game.<br>
            One day, one close friend contacted me with an opurtunity of being an observer for "minor" event, and of course I accepted it!<br>
            Now rest, is history...</p>

            <p>Jokes asside, by receiving a message from same friend, I got my first time opurtunity to be a on-field camera operator.<br>
            Honestly, it was my first time using that kind of professional equipment (for those, who are wondering - Sony PXW-Z90), and<br>
            surprise, surprise, I was actually good with it (except with a focus, because, yes... Autofocus, for me, ruled).</p>

            <h1>Ghetto Games Euroleague Finals 2023</h1>
            <h2>That's something serious...</h2>
            <p>Later that month, I had to learn something new, on which I had huge responsibility: be the man, who is responsible for<br>
            broadcast and LCD display scoreboard, which ment, I can't miss any goals. For information, I was using a software called<br>
            vMix Universal Title Container.</p>

            <h1>Centra Draudze</h1>
            <h2>Being much more involved with broadcast</h2>
            <p>At early august started visiting one of the local churches, which needed people, who would be willing to learn<br>
            something new. There I learned being the audio technician for youth events, and also, I improved my skills with camera.<br>
            At one point I also started to learn being a broadcast director, but at the moment, my skills for that aren't the best.</p>
